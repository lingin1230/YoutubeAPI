        "description": "Beyond fear, destiny awaits. Watch the trailer for the highly anticipated #DuneMovie now. \n\n\n-----------------\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dune\n https://twitter.com/dunemovie\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dunemovie\n-----------------\n\nOscar  nominee  Denis  Villeneuve  (“Arrival,”  “Blade  Runner  2049”)  directs  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary Pictures’ “Dune,” the big-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal bestseller of the same name. A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, “Dune” tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet  in  the  universe  to  ensure  the  future  of  his  family  and  his  people.  As  malevolent  forces  explode  into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence—a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential—only those who can conquer their fear will survive.The film stars Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name,”  “Little Women”), Rebecca Ferguson  (“Stephen  King’s  Doctor  Sleep,”   “Mission:  Impossible  –  Fallout”),  Oscar  Isaac  (the “Star  Wars” franchise) Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Milk,” “Avengers: Infinity War”), Stellan Skarsgård (HBO’s “Chernobyl,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Avengers: Endgame”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” HBO’s “Euphoria”), Chang Chen (“Mr.  Long,” “Crouching  Tiger,  Hidden  Dragon”),    David  Dastmalchian  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “The  Dark  Knight”), Sharon  Duncan-Brewster  (“Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story,”  Netflix’s “Sex  Education”),   with  Oscar  nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), with Jason Momoa (“Aquaman,” HBO’s “Game of Thrones”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Skyfall”).   Villeneuve directed “Dune” from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth based on the novel of the same name written by Frank Herbert.  Villeneuve also produced the film with Mary Parent, Cale Boyter  and  Joe  Caracciolo,  Jr.   The  executive  producers  are  Tanya  Lapointe,  Joshua  Grode,  Herbert  W.  Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt and Kim Herbert. Behind  the  scenes,  Villeneuve  reteamed  with  two-time  Oscar-nominated  production  designer  Patrice  Vermette  (“Arrival,”  “Sicario,”  “The  Young  Victoria”),  two-time  Oscar-nominated  editor  Joe  Walker  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Arrival,”  “12  Years  a  Slave”),  two-time  Oscar-winning  visual  effects  supervisor  Paul  Lambert  (“First Man,” “Blade Runner 2049”), and Oscar-winning special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer (“Blade Runner 2049”).    He  also  collaborated  for  the  first  time  with  Oscar-nominated  director  of  photography  Greig  Fraser  (“Lion,”  “Zero  Dark  Thirty,”  “Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story”);  three-time  Oscar-nominated  costume  designer  \nJacqueline West (“The Revenant,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Quills”) and co-costume designer Bob Morgan; and stunt coordinator Tom Struthers (“The Dark Knight” trilogy, “Inception”).  Oscar-winning and multiple  Oscar-nominated  composer  Hans  Zimmer  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Inception,”  “Gladiator,”  “The  Lion King”) is creating the score.  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary  Pictures  Present  “Dune.”    The  film  is  slated  to  be  released  in  theaters on December 18, 2020.",
